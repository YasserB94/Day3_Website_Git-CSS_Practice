        <q>Let's suppose that you were able every night to dream the dream that you wanted to dream, and you would
            naturally as you began on this adventure of dreams, you would fulfill all your wishes. You would have every
            kind of pleasure,you see, and after several nights you would say, well that was pretty great! But now let's
            have a surprise, lets have a dream which isn't under control. Well something is going to happen to me that I
            dont't know what it's gonna be. then you would get more and more adventourous, and you would make further
            and further out gambles as to what you would dream, and finally you would dream where you are now.</q>
